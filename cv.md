### About myself:
Having started my career as a layout in IT-academy. I successfully completed a course "Website development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript". I made two responsive site pages using HTML and CSS. I made the first page following the example of Figma and the second page of the website for construction of houses. This sphere interested me and I continued studying JavaScript for course "Web application development with JavaScript". At the end ща this course I made a weather forecast application. In this application the user can view the weather by the name of the city for the current moment and for 5 days. The last 10 requests are saved and the weather in this city is shown when you click over them.
I'm interesting  in Web Development because this sphere provides possibilities for developer and I like that I can use not only some mathematical knowledge but also I need change a design and a behavior of elements.
I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.

### Skills and Proficiency:
* HTML5, CSS3;
* JavaScript Basics;
* Git, GitHub;

### Code example:
KATA from CODEWARS: An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.  


    function isIsogram(str){  

      const strLower=str.toLowerCase();
      for (let i=0; i<=strLower.length; i++){
        if(strLower.split(strLower[i]).length-1>1){
          return(false);
            } if(strLower.split(strLower[i]).length-1===0){
            return true;
          } if(strLower.length===0){
            return (true);
        }
      }
    }
